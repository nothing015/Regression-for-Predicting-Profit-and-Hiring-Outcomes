# Linear and Logistic Regression for Predicting Profit and Hiring Outcomes with Multi-Class Classification Techniques
## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of linear and logistic regression to solve two predictive modeling tasks:

Linear Regression: Predicting restaurant profit based on city population.
Logistic Regression: Predicting hiring outcomes based on candidate interview scores.

## Project Structure

Basic Linear Regression: Models the relationship between city population and restaurant profit using linear regression.
Logistic Regression for Binary Classification: Predicts hiring likelihood based on two interview scores.
